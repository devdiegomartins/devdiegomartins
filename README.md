### Welcome, unknow person!

## My history
- My name is Diego Martins and I've been a Delphi developer since version 9.0 (2005) (which was the first version I saw being updated)!
 
- I also became a JavaScript developer in 2010, when I started to have my first experiences with Angular, Ionic and jQuery. Today I am a specialist in the development of hybrid PWA, Web and Mobile applications using ReactJS and React Native.
 
- I am born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I had experiences working for companies in Rio Grande (RS), Novo Hamburgo (RS), Araraquara (SP) and SÃ£o Paulo (SP), some in remote ways and others in person.
 
- My big goal is to evolve professionally and my technical skills in all the projects I do, always taking the experiences given by them.
 
- I do not discard possibilities for new experiences and opportunities, always aware of them in a safe, legal and adaptive way.
